# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction

This project builds and evaluates a neural network to predict median housing prices in California districts using features such as population, median income, housing age, and location.

## 📦 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict the `median_house_value` from other features in the California housing dataset.
- **Dataset**: Derived from the California census data (originally from the StatLib repository).
- **Model**: A simple feedforward neural network built using TensorFlow Keras.
- **Evaluation**: Model is evaluated using cross-validated MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics.
